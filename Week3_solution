Questions:
1.	Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
2.	Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    """
    Calculates the final price after applying a discount.

    Parameters:
    price (float): The original price.
    discount_percent (float): The discount percentage to be applied.

    Returns:
    float: The final price after discount if discount is 20% or higher; otherwise, returns the original price.
    """
    if discount_percent >= 20:
        # Calculate the discount amount
        discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
        # Calculate the final price
        final_price = price - discount_amount
    else:
        # Return the original price if discount is less than 20%
        final_price = price

    return final_price

# Example usage
original_price = 100.0
